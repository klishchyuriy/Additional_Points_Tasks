## Task Description
This task involves performing data analysis on a .csv dataset. You are free to consult pandas docs, Stack Overflow for your questions.

### Dataset
Download the CSV file from: [Sales of a Supermarket](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lovishbansal123/sales-of-a-supermarket)

## Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the provided dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Inspect the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand its structure.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately (e.g., by dropping rows or filling missing values).
- Convert any relevant columns to appropriate data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).

### 3. Data Exploration
- Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns such as total sales, average sales per month, maximum and minimum sales, etc.
- Explore categorical columns such as product categories, sales regions, etc., by counting unique values and visualizing distributions.

### 4. Performance Analysis
- Calculate additional metrics such as profit margins, sales growth rates, and sales contributions by product category or region.
- Identify top-performing products or regions based on sales volume or revenue.

### 5. Hypothesis Testing (Optional)
- Formulate hypotheses about factors that may influence sales (e.g., promotional campaigns, seasonal effects) and perform statistical tests to validate or refute them.
